- **Why build this project:** This project serves as an educational resource for developers and students learning about regular expressions.
- **Problem it solves:** It clarifies the complex syntax of regex by explaining each component in a practical example.
- **What was learned:** Enhanced understanding of regex components such as anchors, quantifiers, OR operators, character classes, bracket expressions, grouping and capturing, and greedy vs. lazy matching.
